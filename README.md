**A semantic, lightweight and extensible framework to power responsive websites.**

For a consistent, cross-browser experience we use [sanitize.css](https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css/).

***

This framework is inspired by the work of [Agensy](https://github.com/agency) with [Base](https://github.com/agency/base) and started as a fork.
